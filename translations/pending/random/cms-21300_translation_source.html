<h1>50 Filters of WordPress: Series Finale</h1>

<p>Welcome to the series finale of "50 Filters of WordPress"! In this last part, we're going to review what we learned and summarize all the 50 filters with 10 words (give or take) each.</p>

<p>Let's begin!</p>

<h2>First Part An Introduction to WordPress Filters</h2>

<p>In the first part of the series, we entered the <em>magical</em> world of WordPress filters and got to know what they are, how they work, when we should use them and how we should use them. We learned:</p>

<p><strong>What a WordPress filter is:</strong> A filter is a function that sits between the database and the browser, <em>doing stuff</em> to your data <em>before</em> WordPress outputs it. WordPress has—literally—hundreds of filters inside its core and you can create your own filters in the things you develop (like plugins). That's what we learned.</p>

<p><strong>How to create a filtering function and hook it to a filter:</strong> It's simple in essence, really: We create a function that plays with the data and we hook it to the corresponding filter hook by using the <code>add_filter()</code> function. (I might have over-simplified it – it's actually a bit more complicated than that.) Be sure to check out the first part of this series, if you haven't already. It's important.</p>

<p><strong>How to remove a function (or functions) from a filter:</strong> We learned two functions in WordPress to remove functions from filters: <code>remove_filter()</code> and <code>remove_all_filters()</code>. (You can probably guess which one removes one function and which one removes all functions hooked to a filter.) We learned how to use these functions.</p>

<p><strong>How to create our own filters:</strong> WordPress has hundreds of awesome filters in its core, but what if we need our plugin to be as flexible and expandable as the core? Well, we create our own filter hooks by using the <code>apply_filters()</code> function. Be sure to check that out, too, if you're a plugin developer.</p>

<h2>Next Five Parts 50 Great Examples for 50 Great Filters</h2>

<p>After entering the world of WordPress filters, the best thing to do would have been getting to know about each and every filter hook in WordPress' core. While that would be the most amazing tutorial series in the history of WordPress tutorials, it would take an incredible amount of time and effort because there are a little over a thousand filters in the core as of WordPress v3.9.1.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean we should sit and learn nothing, though. I chose 50 WordPress filters, introduced them with little paragraphs and done examples with each one. Here's what we learned with brief explanations:</p>

<h2>The End</h2>

<p>So that's the end of it. We're done with the series of WordPress filters – but we're not done with WordPress hooks yet: Stay tuned for another seven-part tutorial on WordPress actions!</p>

<p>Despite the fact that it was the most exhausting series of tutorials, I enjoyed writing every word and every bit of code for I knew it would be a small—but extremely useful—resource on this topic. I learned <em>a lot</em> while writing; I just hope you did as well.</p>

<p>All kinds of contribution will be appreciated, by the way. You can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Share your thoughts on this series by commenting below,</li>
  <li>Suggest new filters and example ideas for an "addendum" part or two,</li>
  <li>Offer ways to improve my writing if you caught a mistake, incoherency or ambiguity in my posts,</li>
  <li>And share these tutorials anywhere for everyone to see and learn about WordPress filters!</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for bearing with me till the end. Goodbye!</p>
