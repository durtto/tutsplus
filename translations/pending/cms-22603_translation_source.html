<p>When Apple released their new iPhone line, they also introduced the world to <strong>Apple Pay</strong>. A new credit card replacement application that is built into the iPhone 6 and 6+. </p>

<p>With <strong>Apple Pay</strong>, you insert your credit or debit cards into the <strong>Passport</strong> application. The next time you need to pay for something, you simple use the cards that are securely stored on the phone. </p>

<p>This process saves you time, energy, and wallet storage space. Instead of carrying around a bunch of plastic cards, <strong>Apple Pay</strong> allows you to store, then use any card you like.</p>

<p>The only drawback to <strong>Apple Pay</strong> is that the only iPhones capable of this wizardry right now are the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6+. But once the <strong>iWatch</strong> is released, Apple's site specifically states that the <strong>iWatch</strong> can pair with a 5, 5s, or 5c and make <strong>Apple Pay</strong> transactions via the digital crown.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add a credit or debit card to <strong>Apple Pay</strong></li>
  <li>Use <strong>Apple Pay</strong> within 3rd party applications, like Groupon</li>
  <li>Use <strong>Apple Pay</strong> in a retail store</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting Up Apple Pay</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> The use of <strong>Apple Pay</strong> requires you to have your fingerprint and passcode locks in place. If you haven't already done so, now would be a good time to do that.</p>

<p>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>. Scroll down and click on <strong>Passbook &amp; Apple Pay</strong>. Choose <strong>Add Credit or Debit Card</strong>. Lay a credit or debit card face up on a flat surface in front of the phone. Click the <strong>camera icon</strong> next to card number to use the built in iSight camera to scan the card into Apple Pay.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You could manually enter all of the credit card information instead of using <strong>iSight</strong>, but where is the fun in that?</p>

<p>Finish entering the card info by manually inputing the <strong>expiration date</strong> and <strong>CVC code</strong> from the signature line. If the card's issuing bank is an active partner in <strong>Apple Pay</strong>, the card will verify and be added to your passport as an <strong>Apple Pay</strong> option. You may have to agree to some additional terms and conditions or verify your intent via an emailed passcode. But that process will vary from bank to bank.</p>

<p>If your bank is not currently an <strong>Apple Pay</strong> partner, you will see a message that says: <strong>Your Issuer Does Not Yet Offer Support for This Card</strong>. Refer to this list of <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features-com" target="_self">participating banks</a>.</p>

<h2>Using Apple Pay in Apps</h2>

<p>Once you have a card added, you are ready to start using third-party applications. These are the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewFeature?id=927678292&amp;mt=8&amp;ls=1" target="_self">applications that support purchases through Apple Pay</a>. For demonstration purposes, I'm going to show you how to make a purchase in the <strong>Groupon</strong> app.</p>

<p>Launch Groupon and click on the <strong>menu tab</strong> on the bottom left. Then click on <strong>profile</strong> and go to <strong>payment methods</strong>. Choose <strong>Apple Pay</strong> as your primary payment method. Click the <strong>X</strong> in the top right to close the profile. Find a deal you would like to purchase. </p>

<p>Then click the <strong>Apple Pay button</strong> on the bottom right. You will be asked to verify the purchase by putting your fingerprint over the home key so the touch ID scanner can verify the identity of the person making the purchase.</p>

<p>Congratulations you've made your very first <strong>Apple pay</strong> purchase.</p>

<h2>Using Apple Pay in a Retail Store</h2>

<p>When <strong>Apple Pay</strong> launched it was already available in several major retailers worldwide. These include names like <em>McDonald's</em>, <em>Nike</em>, <em>Subway</em>, and many more. Refer to the list of <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/?cid=wwa-us-kwg-features-com" target="_self">retailers that accept Apple Pay</a>. The team at Apple is actively working to add more retail partnerships daily. So keep checking back. That list is bound to grow.</p>

<p>To use <strong>Apple pay</strong> inside of a brick-and-mortar establishment, find the items you'd like to purchase and bring them to the checkout counter. If you are in a restaurant, order them from the menu. In other words, shop like you normally would. </p>

<p>During check out bring up the passport application on the iPhone. </p>

<p>Choose the card you'd like to use and bring your phone close to the credit card reader. You will hear a long beep sound. This indicates that the NFC chip in your phone is communicating properly with the NFC reader in the credit card terminal.</p>

<p>Hold the phone there until you're prompted to authorize the payment by putting your finger onto the scanner. Place your finger over the scanner on the home button to authorize. You will see a message that the charge was successful and the cashier will hand you a receipt.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Nowadays we carry far too many credit cards in our wallets. Not only is it bad for our back or posture, but it's probably the least secure way to pay for items in existence today. </p>

<p>Using <strong>Apple Pay</strong> you can store credit cards electronically, pay for goods or services quicker, and generally enjoy a more secure check out process. This feature alone makes the upgrade to the iPhone 6 or 6+ well worth it.</p>
